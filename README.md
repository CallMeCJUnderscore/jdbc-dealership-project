This is the end-of-week workshop for Week 10 of the Fall 2023 Course of the Pluralsight Learn-to-Code Academy.

## Details
This project contains a Java CLI application designed to interface with a SQL database of car dealerships and the inventory contained therein. A script to set up said database has been provided. The database script and skeleton of application as a whole, were provided by the program's instructor, Raymond, with me creating the logic for all the DAOs located inside the db folder.
